# ML_classical_models

This project involves the implementation and evaluation of three classical machine learning models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Each model is trained on different datasets and evaluated using various methods. The project also includes preprocessing tasks such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), among others.
